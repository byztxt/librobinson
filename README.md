# librobinson
A Python library for reading the Robinson file format for Greek texts.

# Say again?

Dr. Maurice A. Robinson makes available a number of high quality Greek
texts with morphology, Strong's numbers, and (in some cases) variants.

These files need some work in order to be read properly.  This library
aims to help in that work.

# Whodunnit?

Dr. Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen of [Scripture Systems ApS](http://scripturesys.com).

James Tauber contributed some of the code for the convert.py script.

# Installation

```
$ pip install librobinson
```

# Support?  Patches?

Yes.  Please email ulrikp<writeTheSign>scripturesys|dot|com.

Or, even better, fork on GitHub and submit a pull request.

# License?

MIT License for most of the code.

The file "convert.py" has a different license.

Enjoy!

Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen
